# The aim of the assessment 
The game Debt Deception was made for the Year 10 assessment for Industrial Technology, the topic being "Games for change" We were required to make a 2D Platformer Game using Unity, creating assets using Piskel and Github to create a respiratory for out game. Applying my understanding of programming and game engines, I produced a READ.md to promote the skills integrated into the game  to a future employer.

 On the keyboard the keys A & D are used to move left and right when the space bar is pressed the character jumps in the air, and the left mouse is used to interact with the inventory slot. 
 
 On the controller, the left joystick allows the character to move left and right, and the button Y allows the character to jump, unfortunately, the dash and movement of the cursor are unresponsive in the game. 
   
# What I intended to make 

I intended to make a game called Debt Deception, a 2D game designed for PC and consoles, combining elements from "Fake It to Make It" and "Night of the Living Debt." The game begins with two selectable characters each with their own stories, each finding themselves in debt through advertisements taking them to a fake website. As the player, your goal is to help them reduce their debt by taking down the website's owners. The game features various challenges that are both educational and entertaining, teaching financial literacy along the way. Players will encounter zombies, symbolizing debt, and as well as the player must navigate obstacles by going up and down to avoid the accessories from increasing their debt. Additionally, players can create their own fake websites to earn money and reduce debt. The final battle is against the villain behind the fake website, where players use financial knowledge to defeat him. Power-ups, such as the "Debt Destroyer," can be earned by answering financial literacy questions correctly. 

The game targets teenagers with credit cards, aiming to teach them about financial decisions' consequences and distinguishing between fake and real websites, hopefully potentially teaching them the differences between fake and a real website and learning about financial literacy. 

# What I made 
My game was fairly close to what I intended to make though unfortunately I was unable to make a selectable character option, a fake website. But was able to create a power that can only be used through a question and a fun challenge.
